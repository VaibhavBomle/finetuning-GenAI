# finetuning-GenAI
# Steps:
1.Install Required Packages: The script starts by installing necessary libraries such as datasets, transformers, trl, peft, etc.


2.Model & Data Preparation: The ZephyrTrainer class initializes configuration, loads the dataset, and processes it into a format suitable for training. It then downloads the GPTQ-based model and prepares it for LoRA fine-tuning.


3.Fine-Tuning: The train() method uses SFTTrainer to fine-tune the model on the processed dataset using specified training arguments.


4.Model Deployment: After training, the fine-tuned model is pushed to the Hugging Face Hub, and a final section demonstrates generating responses using the model.


5.Inference: The model generates a response to a customer support query using a preprocessed instruction format, and the result is printed.


# Summary:
The code fine-tunes a GPTQ-based model (Zephyr-7B) on a customer support dataset using LoRA via the PEFT framework. After installing dependencies, it processes the dataset and prepares the model for k-bit training. The SFTTrainer is used for fine-tuning, and the final model is uploaded to the Hugging Face Hub. Finally, the script demonstrates generating responses by loading the fine-tuned model and providing an instruction-based input. This enables the creation of a specialized support chatbot model.
